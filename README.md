Our idea is to make a website that will display a list of TCG Pokemon cards along with each card's images, price, rarity, and description.

The code that we commit together is inside the master branch, however we still cannot link the database with the view. In the "fauzan" branch we have tried to make it so that a part of the html can link to the database but we got the error in which the connection to the database cannot be established.
